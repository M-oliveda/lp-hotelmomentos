# Landing page project: **Hotel Momentos**

This repository contains a project for developing and designing a landing page project for a hotel company located in my city (Santa Fe, Argentina).

It will use a one-page website approach. Also, the website will be fully responsive and use the mobile-first principle.

For the design process, I will use Figma. And for the development, I will use HTML, CSS (using the SASS preprocessor) and JavaScript.

## Planning steps

These will be the process of this project:

First day: I will talk to the client to know their requirements.
Second and third day: I will design and prototype the website.
Fourth, five and last day: I will develop and finally test the website to deliver the result to the client.
